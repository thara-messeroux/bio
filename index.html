        <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">I began my career by studying architecture, and I eventually discovered the importance of programming skills in designing 3D Modeling, and 3D Printing for work deliverables. I later realized that software engineering can help solve complex problems throughout every industry. My interest in software development stems from my curiosity for new technologies, and my desire to find answers to complex problems.</p>

        <h3>Architecture and Interior Design</h3>
        <p class="design-skill-description">As an Architectural Designer, I developed a variety of skills necessary for success in the field of Computer Science, including the ability to learn new knowledge quickly to solve problems, excellent verbal communication skills, customer service skills, and the ability to work well in a team to complete group projects.

I am adaptable to changing environments, have great attention to detail, and I am always excited to learn new skills and technologies. I love coding in Python, Java, and C, have a great foundation of object-oriented design, and have some knowledge of Computer Systems.</p>
